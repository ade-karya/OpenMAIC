# Clone Or Reuse Existing Repo

## Goal

Establish which KelasKA checkout will be used for setup and runtime actions.

## Procedure

1. Check whether KelasKA already exists locally.
2. If a checkout exists, show the path and ask whether to reuse it.
3. If no checkout exists, propose cloning the repo and ask for confirmation.
4. After clone, confirm dependency installation separately.

## Recommended Path

- Recommended: reuse an existing checkout if it is already on the `Sekolah` branch.
- Otherwise: clone a fresh checkout from GitHub, switch to the `Sekolah` branch, then install dependencies.

## Commands

Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ade-karya/KelasKA.git
cd KelasKA
git checkout Sekolah
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Confirmation Requirements

- Ask before `git clone`.
- Ask before `git checkout Sekolah` if the repo already exists and has local changes.
- Ask before `pnpm install`.
- If the repo is dirty, tell the user and ask whether to continue with that checkout.
